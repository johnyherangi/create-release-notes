# Create Release Notes

This action compiles the commits between the latest release tag and a head ref into release notes. For use with [actions/create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release).

-   If no release tags exist, only the `head-ref` commit will be compiled.

## Inputs

### `head-ref`

**Optional** Custom head ref. Default is `HEAD`.

### `format`

**Optional** Release note format. Default is `- {{subject}} by @{{author}}`.

> Usable commit values: `subject`, `author`, `committer` and `message`

Values can also be piped in the event that one commit value is missing e.g.

```
- {{subject}} by @{{author|committer}}
```

## Outputs

### `release-name`

Contains the `subject` of the latest commit in the release notes e.g.

```
Do more stuff (#2)
```

### `release-notes`

Multi-lined release notes e.g.

```
- Do more stuff (#2) by @johnyherangi
- Do stuff (#1) by @johnyherangi
```
